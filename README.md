# Deep Learning Based Autonomous Navigation over Economical Hardware

![DIPCar Logo](placeholder_for_logo.png)

## 🚗 Driving Innovation in Autonomous Navigation

DIPCar is a cutting-edge Final Year Project (FYP) that brings together deep learning and robotics to create an autonomous navigation system using a Jetson Nano. Our project transforms a simple toy car into a smart, self-driving vehicle capable of understanding and reacting to its environment in real-time.

### 🎯 Key Features

- **Object Detection**: Utilizing a custom-trained model to recognize 12 different classes of objects, including vehicles, pedestrians, and traffic signs.
- **Intelligent Decision Making**: Real-time processing of detected objects to control the car's movement.
- **Adaptive Speed Control**: Automatic adjustment of speed based on detected speed limit signs.
- **Safety First**: Immediate response to stop signs, ensuring safe navigation.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed for easy expansion and integration of new features.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Hardware**: Jetson Nano, DC motors, Camera module
- **Software**: Python, JetPack SDK, TensorRT
- **Deep Learning Framework**: PyTorch
- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV, jetson-inference
